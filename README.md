 Title: Research Paper Recommendation Sytem
 Overview:
 This project is a Research Paper Recommendation System designed to assist researchers in finding 
 relevant papers based on the title of a research paper. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
 and machine learning preprocessing techniques to provide the top 5 related research papers.

 The motivation for this project stemmed from personal experience as a beginner researcher, 
 struggling to find relevant papers during a research internship. The goal is to create a tool to 
 help other beginner researchers efficiently locate pertinent research papers.

 2.Utilizes the ArXiv dataset for training and testing.
 
 3.Includes a user-friendly frontend built with HTML and CSS.
 
 4.Developed a Flask web application running on a local server.
 
 Technologies Used:
 1.NLP Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Sentence Transformers)
 
 2.Dataset: ArXiv research papers
 
 3.Frontend: HTML, CSS
 
 4.Backend: Flask (Python)
